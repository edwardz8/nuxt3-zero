The general strategy is to take the best player available based on the rankings provided by Underdog or other sites you are depending on for your player rankings. This is fairly obvious, sure, but where the strategy then comes into play is how you want to fill your positions based on ADP (average draft position). If your first pick is one of the top centers in the league, then you may want to go with another position even if the best available at your second pick is another center. This is because every week your points are only allocated for one center, even though there is one flex position, as well, which could come from any position outside of goalie."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The top centers to target are Connor McDavid, Auston Matthews, Nathan Mackinnon, and Leon Draisaitl.

It is going to be a lot tougher to get a quality defenseman in the later rounds than it will be to find a wing or even center later in the draft. One player to target could be Adam Fox, who recorded 74 points in 2021, in the third round. After Roman Josi, Cale Makar, Victor Hedman, Fox Darnell Nurse and John Carlson, it seems there is a massive drop off in production from other defenseman.
