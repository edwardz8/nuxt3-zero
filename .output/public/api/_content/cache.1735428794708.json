The general strategy is to take the best player available based on the rankings provided by Underdog or other sites you are depending on for your player rankings. This is fairly obvious, sure, but where the strategy then comes into play is how you want to fill your positions based on ADP (average draft position). If your first pick is one of the top centers in the league, then you may want to go with another position even if the best available at your second pick is another center. This is because every week your points are only allocated for one center, even though there is one flex position, as well, which could come from any position outside of goalie."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The top centers to target are Connor McDavid, Auston Matthews, Nathan Mackinnon, and Leon Draisaitl.

There will still be some quality centers left in the second or early third round to draft like Mikko Rantenan, Sebastion Aho and Aleksander Barkov. Even a center like Steven Stamkos, who scored the fifth most center goals last season and had the fourth most points by a center with 106; he is commonly being drafted in the third round."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Underdog Best Ball Scoring","src":"/img/underdog.jpeg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Another important aspect to remember is that two wingers scores count as there are no other positions counted twice. So while it is important to get a top center if you can, you will also need to get at least two quality wings with multiple wing backups. A strategy would be to get some wing players early, such as Kirill Kaprizov, who was great last season with 47 goals and had seven goals in just six playoff games or Alex Ovechkin who still managed a 50-goal season last year. There are obviously more wingers and centers than d-men, but it's important to note that the scoring averages are more significant than one may think from the top 15-20 wingers and centers than it is when looking at d-men."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You will then want to use a bunch of your 10 bench spots on wings.

You will probably want to do this pretty early as there is a big drop off in top defenseman, quickly. The third or even second round is advisable to take a defenseman to ensure your one defense slot is filled by a top player. It is going to be a lot tougher to get a quality defenseman in the later rounds than it will be to find a wing or even center later in the draft. One player to target could be Adam Fox, who recorded 74 points in 2021, in the third round. After Roman Josi, Cale Makar, Victor Hedman, Fox Darnell Nurse and John Carlson, it seems there is a massive drop off in production from other defenseman. These players can probably be counted on for 70+ points next year while the rest of the field will be lucky to get 60.

One of those is Maple Leafs’ goalie, Ilya Samsonov, who should be available late and is set to have a rebound season with his new team. Another is Marc-Andre Fleury who is expected to have a big year; he can be drafted outside of the top 10 goalies. The veteran net-minder recorded 28 wins last year and over 1,700 saves in just 56 games and could very well improve upon that performance in 2022. Ultimately, it is up to you if you want to secure an every night net-minder, but it's an advantageous move to let others secure one early and to load up late on them and fill your bench with 3 incase of emergency."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hey there!
