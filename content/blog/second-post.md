# Favorite Props for NFL Sunday Week 1 🏈 

> Hey! Thanks for checking out our first full-slate props article of the 2022 NFL season. We nailed all but one of our bets for the Bills vs Rams game and kicked the year off right. Let's keep it rolling. 🦵 As always, we will primarily reference FanDuel.


## Any Time Touchdown Scorer

#### Austin Ekeler 

This speedy scat-back has been stupid good in his last 2 games against the Raiders, finding the endzone twice through the air and twice on the ground. I'm also taking Ekeler for over 25 yards receiving since he's reached that mark in his past two appearances against Las Vegas; his rushing props should also be considered as he reached 100+ a couple games back. This mid-day divisional matchup has one of the highest point totals on the Sunday slate, which usually bodes well for running backs, especially in high-powered offenses like the Chargers. I plan to have multiple plays for this game as there should be plenty of scoring opportunities for both teams.

#### Joe Mixon 

Mixon found paydirt twice during his last outing this past November at home and we like for him to get at least 1 again in another home matchup. In his 3 appearances facing the division-rival Steelers, Mixon has recorded at least 79 yards rushing and has been given no less than 18 attempts.

#### Jonathan Taylor

The top RB in the league faces a bottom-feeding team. The Colts will make a statement this game in what will be the start of their conquest of dethroning the Tennessee Titans in the AFC South. In order to do that they are going to feed Taylor early and often to set the tone off right with a touchdown. This should cash easy. 

#### James Conner 



## Moneylines and Spreads 💰

I'm taking mostly favorites on the road this week. 

#### Indianapolis Colts -335 @ Houston Texans 

#### Philadelphia Eagles -205 @ Detroit Lions

#### Baltimore Ravens -310 @ New York Jets 🔒

#### San Francisco 49ers -330 @ Chicago Bears 

#### Las Vegas Raiders +13.5 @ Las Angeles Chargers 🔒

#### Tampa Bay Buccaneers +13.5 @ Dallas Cowboys

Brady has never lost to the Cowboys during his time in Tampa and even with a down offensive lineman and the unlikely appearance of Chris Godwin it's hard to see the Bucs getting blown out in this one.



## Rushing Props

#### Lamar Jackson 40+ yards

Jackson rushed for 86 yards the last time he faced the Jets during his 2019 NFL MVP season. I expect him to return to a similar caliber of play after a mediocre 2021 campaign and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better team to loosen up with than New York.

## Receiving Props 

#### Davante Adams 50+ yards

Reunited with his former college QB, it's going to be tough to contain the top wideout in the league in what's setup to be a fun, aerial affair. 🔒

#### Tyreek Hill 50+ yards

No more Patrick Mahomes but 





i've been giving props.cash while looking ahead to the upcoming NFL season; it's easy to use and has convenient and easy-to-understand stats for both casual and expert players alike. i've enjoyed it so far; i'm a sucker for beautiful vizualizations so that's a plus and there's both a free and paid version for those wanting to give the app a shot. i'm sticking with the free version for now as it includes a lot of useful data for player props [props.cash](https://props.cash/)
