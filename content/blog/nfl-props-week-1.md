# Favorite Props for NFL Sunday Week 1 üèà 

> Hey there! Thanks for checking out our first full-slate props article of the 2022 NFL season. We nailed all but one of our bets for the Bills vs Rams game and kicked the year off right. Let's keep it rolling. ü¶µ These are mostly conservative projections and are what we consider bankroll builders. As always, we will primarily reference FanDuel.


## Any Time Touchdown Scorer


#### Jonathan Taylor

The top RB in the league faces a bottom-feeding team. The Colts will make a statement this game in what will be the start of their conquest of dethroning the Tennessee Titans in the AFC South. In order to do that they are going to feed Taylor early and often to set the tone off right with a touchdown. This should cash easy.

#### Austin Ekeler

The speedy scat-back has been stupid good in his last 2 games against the Raiders, finding the endzone twice through the air and twice on the ground. I'm also taking Ekeler for over 25 yards receiving since he's reached that mark in his past two appearances against Las Vegas; his rushing props should also be considered as he reached 100+ a couple games back.

‚ö° 

This mid-day divisional matchup has one of the highest point totals on the Sunday slate, which usually bodes well for running backs, especially in high-powered offenses like the Chargers. I plan to have multiple plays for this game as there should be plenty of scoring opportunities for both teams.

#### Joe Mixon üêÖ

Mixon found paydirt twice during his last outing this past November at home and we like for him to get at least 1 again in another home matchup. In his 3 appearances facing the division-rival Steelers, Mixon has recorded at least 79 yards rushing and has been given no less than 18 attempts.

## Rushing Props

#### Lamar Jackson 40+ yards

Jackson rushed for 86 yards the last time he faced the Jets during his 2019 NFL MVP season. I expect him to return to a similar caliber of play after a mediocre 2021 campaign and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better team to loosen up with than New York.

## Receiving Props 

#### Davante Adams 50+ yards 

Reunited with his former college QB, it's going to be tough to contain the top wideout in the league in what's setup to be a fun, aerial affair. üîí üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

#### Tyreek Hill 50+ yards

Hill has faced the Patriots a total of 4 times in his career; in the first 2 -- back in 2017 and 2018 -- he was a complete matchup nightmare, as he scorched the defense for 4 touchdowns and reached at least 133 yards in both games, however, New England essentially found a way to make the Cheetah a non-factor during the 2 most recent games and even though he recorded a score, he failed to reach 65 yards in either. And sure, no more Patrick Mahomes, but the 5th-year speedster should find a happy medium in this one down in Miami.

#### T.J. Hockenson 25+ yards

The Lions will be looking to bounce back from the embarrasing 44-6 loss they endured last October against the Eagles. Hockenson's statline was the only bright spot about that game for Detroit as he recorded 10 receptions for 89 yards. Again, this is a conservative line I'm taking on the 6'5", 244 lbs tight end at -470 odds but the 40+ Alt Receiving Yds at -168 is tempting as well and wouldn't blame you if you wanted to get a little frisky.


## Moneylines and Spreads üí∞

I'm taking mostly favorites on the road this week. 

#### Indianapolis Colts -335 @ Houston Texans

Davis Mills vs the veteran Matt Ryan in a Week 1 divisional matchup. The Colts will want to get the awful taste of defeat out of their mouths after barely missing the playoffs last season when they took the L against Jacksonville in Week 17. 

#### Philadelphia Eagles -205 @ Detroit Lions

The Lions lost a lot of close games in 2021, but the Eagles game wasn't one of them as Philly handed them a 44-6 loss. It's a new season and there's more film on Hurts, and while this should be a closer game than the previously aforementioned matchup, the Lions are still a very young team with an incredibly mediocre QB.

#### Baltimore Ravens -310 @ New York Jets üîí

#### San Francisco 49ers -330 @ Chicago Bears 

Trey Lance vs Justin Fields should be an exciting matchup of young guns and while we've seen less of the former than the latter, the 49ers should take this one on the road.

#### Las Vegas Raiders +13.5 @ Las Angeles Chargers üîí

#### Tampa Bay Buccaneers +13.5 @ Dallas Cowboys

Brady has never lost to the Cowboys during his time in Tampa and even with a down offensive lineman and the unlikely appearance of Chris Godwin it's hard to see the Bucs getting blown out in this one.
