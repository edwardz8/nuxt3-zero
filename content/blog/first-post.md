## Props for Bills @ Rams 🏈 

> Hey there! Thanks for checking out the first player props article of the 2022 NFL season. The Bills vs Rams kick the year off and we couldn't be more excited to bring you our thoughts and statistically and educated take on player props. 🦵

The books have released the majority of their props for the Bills vs Rams game this Thursday so we'll be laying out some of our favorite plays of the night. The first game can be tough to gauge but most of them are and we haven't ever let that stop us before, so let's dive right in. We will primarily reference FanDuel here.


## Passing Props

#### Matthew Stafford - Under 268.5 yards 

The Super Bowl winning quarterback is set to play in this heavyweight Week 1 matchup but his "dead arm" concerns me so I'm not banking on Stafford having a stellar performance.

#### Josh Allen 200+ yards




#### Stefon Digs 40+ yards

Outside of the one game with the Vikings, Statmuse shows Diggs being held in check when facing the Rams secondary. I may include 1 unit that involves Diggs to score because it's Diggs and it's most definitely possible that Allen finds his top wideout for a touchdown, however, I'm not going to go a different route this week.


## Any Time Touchdown Scorer

I'm not including all of these in a parlay because that's a dumb idea and I would never have one of those (__sarcasm__)! But spreading them out and including one of each in a 4 or 5 leg parlay is a smarter play and is a great way to miss by one leg; and I'm an expert at accomplishing that.

#### Gabriel Davis - Any Time Touchdown Scorer

Davis recorded 4 touchdowns in the Bills' last 6 games of the regular season and then exploded for 4 more during their heartbreaking overtime NFC Divisional Round loss against the Chiefs. I think he picks up right where he left off and improves on his solid 2021 season. And I think it starts Week 1.

#### Devin Singletary - Any Time Touchdown Scorer 

The Bills' primary back went crazy during the final 4 games of the regular season last season, scoring 6 touchdowns and followed it up by adding 3 more during the playoffs. Singletary is entering his 4th season with some stiff competition as the Bills added James Cook to the mix during this years draft, however, with it being Week 1 there's no reason to think the offense of this caliber (even with the departure of the offensive coordinator) will make a drastic change this early in the season.

## Rushing Props

#### Cam Akers - Over 43.5 yards

## Receiving Props 

#### Cooper Kupp 70 + yards receiving
