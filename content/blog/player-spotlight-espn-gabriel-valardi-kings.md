The Los Angeles Kings' forward cannot be contained to start the 2022 NHL season as he's scoring overtime goals, power-play goals, throwing hits and dishing apples (assists). Through the first 5 games, he's already tied his 2021-22 season totals of 7 points (25 games).

Aside from game 1, he's been good for at least 2 shots on goal. Snatch him up in your fantasy league as he's only rostered in 11% of leagues yet is the 5th ranked forward in ESPN leagues.
