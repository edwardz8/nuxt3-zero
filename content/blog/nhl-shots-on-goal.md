# NHL Shots on Goal: Players to Target

Going back over the past week of stats there's a number of players putting a lot of pucks on net who have plus money odds to record 3 - 5 shots on goal. Let's see some of the top plays to take from the books.

> This article will cover both the 3-game slate tonight (October 26, 2022) and Thursday's full 10-game slate. Since puck drop is still over 24 hours away for the majority of the following players, continue to check back for when more props have been added on FanDuel and DraftKings. 


## Top Options for Wednesday

#### Steven Stamkos

The veteran center has posted 14 shots over the last 4 games for the Lightning and is averaging over 21 minutes of ice time with a 21% shooting percentage (S%). Stamkos has a nice matchup today against the Ducks who are giving up the most shots on goal of any other defense this season.

#### Leon Draisaitl

The Edmonton center is averaging 20:47 minutes of time on ice and has 13 shots in the past 3 games. He also has a shooting percentage of 15% over that span.

#### Evander Kane 

Recording 16 shots in 3 games, the Edmonton wing is playing over 21 minutes per game with a solid 12.5% shooting percentage.

#### Artemi Panarin

Panarin has dished out 13 shots over the past 3 games. Pairing the young wing alongside Zibanajed to each have 3+ goals provides +173 odds tonight.

#### Mika Zibanajed 

The Rangers' center is seeing 21 minutes of ice time per game and has 23 shots on goal in his 4 most recent games. He also holds an 8.7% shooting percentage.


## Top Options for Thursday

The following are players to target for Thursday (October 27, 2022). Again, continue to check back as props are posted.  

#### Brady Tkachuk 

The elite winger is the first of many Ottawa Senators who make this list. Following the unfortunate long-term injury of Josh Norris -- who takes up a lot of ice time for the Senators -- there's going to be a lot of shots to go around. 

Tkachuk has posted 14 shots in the last 3 games and holds a shoooting percentage of 21% while averaging 17 minutes of ice time.

#### Andrei Svechnikov 

The Carolina wing has 12 shots in the last 3 games played with a crazy 33% shooting percentage and is averaging nearly 20 minutes of ice time.

### Shayne Gostisbehere 

The Arizona defenseman is starting to come to form with his new team, with 14 shots on goal in his last 3 games while averaging over 20 minutes of time on ice.

He holds a 12% shooting percentage and scored 2 goals in Tuesday's matchup against Columbus.

#### John Tavares

The 32-year-old center has put up 15 shots over the last 3 games while possessing a 13% shot percentage.

#### Evgeni Malkin

The Malkin Jewel (it's a The Mars Volta reference) has thrown 20 shots up to the net in the past 5 games. The veteran center has averaged over 18 minutes of time on ice while posting a 15% shooting percentage.

#### Alex DeBrincat

DeBrincat is seeing continued success with his new squad, the Ottawa Senators, and has put up 19 shots on goal in the last 4 games. The winger has a 5.3% shooting percentage.

#### Matthew Tkachuk 

14.3% shooting percentage. 20 minutes of ice time.

#### Thomas Chabot

It obviously wouldn't be wise to add all Ottawa players to a 3 or 4+ shots on goal same game parlay plus (SGP+) -- which one isn't able to do on FanDuel anyway -- but if one wanted to pair one Senator with someone like Draisaitl or Malkin to get 3 or 4 shots to reach +500 odds or more that could potentially prove lucrative.

With that said, the veteran Sens' defenseman provides more than 24 minutes of average time on ice and has posted 14 shots on net in the past 3 games. 

#### Drake Batherson 

14 shots on goal in the past 3 games. 14 S%. 17 minutes TOI.

<img src="/img/DrakeBatherson.png" alt="player" width="200" />

#### Timo Meier

The former 9th overall pick leads all skaters in shots on goal and over his 5 most recent games has recorded 23 shots. Meier is averaging 18:76 TOI.

#### David Pastrnak 

The Bruins' face of the franchise has posted 16 shots over the last 3 games.
