# NHL Puck Props - Sunday October 22

> Hey there! Thanks for checking out the first player props article of the 2023 NHL season. We are excited to bring you our thoughts and statistically-informed take on player props. We will primarily reference DraftKings and FanDuel in this series.


## First Goalscorer Props 

#### Alex DeBrincat 

##### First To Score: +1000

The Calgary Flames take on the Detroit Red Wings to start off the small 2-game slate tonight. The over is set at 6.5

Detroit is on a back-to-back after traveling to Ottawa and dismantling the Senators, the Red Wings will look to continue their torrid start to the season.  

DeBrincat has 5 goals in 5 games -- he failed to score yesterday in his first game against his former Ottawa Senators -- and the Michigan-native is averaging 17:02 minutes time on ice (TOI) along with 2:40 minutes of Power Player TOI where 2 of his 5 aforementioned goals have taken place.

#### Elias Lindholm

##### First To Score: +1000

In his time with the Calgary Flames, Lindholm has 5 goals in 8 games against Detroit so if you're not comfortable with taking first goal scorer of the game, you can still get anytime scorer at plus money (+160) on DK. It's worth mentioning, Red Wings' netminder, James Reimer recorded a shutout in his first start of the season a few games back, but the Flames should get on the board at least once tonight and Lindholm has a nice matchup against the Detroit defense. The 28-year-old Swede has recorded 2 goals in 5 games and is averaging over 21 minutes of TOI. 

## Goalscorer Props

#### Dylan Larkin 

##### Anytime Scorer: +175

The veteran center has recorded 2 goals in 5 games (9 points) and is averaging nearly 19 minutes of TOI. Over the span of his career, Larkin has scored in 7 of 14 games against Calgary.
