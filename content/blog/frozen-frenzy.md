# NHL Frozen Frenzy - Tuesday October 24

> With 13 games on tonight there's going to be plenty of plays to choose from and it could be easy to get overwhelmed and lose control of your bankroll, but let's have some fun with and take advantage of the Frozen Frenzy deep slate! And as always, thanks for checking out the second player props article of the 2023 NHL season. We are excited to bring you our thoughts and statistically-informed take on player props. We will primarily reference DraftKings and FanDuel this season.

## Shots and Goal Scorers

#### Connor Bedard - Over 3.5

The 18-year-old already has 2 goals on 22 shots through 6 games and is averaging 3.7 shots per game.

#### Nathan MacKinnon - Under 4.5 - +100

MacKinnon has only hit this mark twice in 5 games this season, albeit one of the times when he went over he posted 14 shots. With that said, I like for #29 to score for his 3rd game in a row as it's still listed at +100.

#### Leon Draisaitl - Over 3.5 - +114

The 6' 2" Center has 4 goals in 5 games so far in 2023 and has failed to score in Edmonton's past 2 contests, but with McDavid out for the next 2 weeks, the talented underrated Center should be taking even more shots than he already is and the chances of him finding the back of the net tonight in Minnesota are pretty good against a middle-of-the-road Wild defense.

#### Jack Hughes - Over 3.5 

Hughes has a nice matchup against Montreal despite the Canadiens allowing just 1 goal last night in Buffalo -- but they are on a back-to-back -- so look for the 22-year-old Center to record his 5th goal during his 5th game of this young 2023-24 season. 

#### Nikita Kucherov - Over 3.5 - -105

Kucherov recored 2 goals in the Lightning's last matchup on Saturday and in a home matchup against the Hurricanes tonight the odds of -105 for him to record over 3.5 shots on goal are too good for me to pass up personally. Steven Stamkos is another one to target to either score () or for his shots (over 2.5 is -135 on DK) and parlay his first goal or anytime goal scorer prop with a Tampa Bay win. I placed the Tampa Bay moneyline along with both Stamkos and Kucherov to score for +625.

#### Auston Matthews - 7 shots on goal - +320 

The Capitals have not been very good to start the season but if you'd rather play it safe, Matthews has reached at least the 4 shots on goal mark in all 3 of his most recent games against D.C. so on FanDuel one could parlay Toronto -1.5 with his 4 shots on goal for around +200.

## Longshot 

This is just a longshot lotto so, as always, bet what you can afford to lose and mix and match the guys you like; first goal scorers are tough and it's all luck so don't take it too seriously.
